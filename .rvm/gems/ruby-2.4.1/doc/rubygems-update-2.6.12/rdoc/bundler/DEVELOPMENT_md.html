<p>Great to have you here! Here are a few ways you can help out with <a
href="http://github.com/bundler/bundler">Bundler</a>.</p>

<h1 id="label-Where+should+I+start-3F">Where should I start?<span><a href="#label-Where+should+I+start-3F">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>You can start learning about Bundler by reading <a
href="http://bundler.io">the documentation</a>. If you want, you can also
read a (lengthy) explanation of <a
href="http://bundler.io/rationale.html">why Bundler exists and what it
does</a>. You can also check out discussions about Bundler on the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/group/ruby-bundler">Bundler mailing
list</a> and in the <a
href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23bundler">Bundler IRC
channel</a>, which is bundler on Freenode. Please note that this project is
released with a contributor <a href="http://bundler.io/conduct.html">code
of conduct</a>. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its
terms.</p>

<h2 id="label-Your+first+commits">Your first commits<span><a href="#label-Your+first+commits">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>If you’re interested in contributing to Bundler, that’s awesome! We’d love
your help.</p>

<p>If you have any questions after reading this page, please feel free to
contact either <a href="https://github.com/indirect">@indirect</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/segiddins">@segiddins</a>, or <a
href="https://github.com/RochesterinNYC">@RochesterinNYC</a>. They are all
happy to provide help working through your first bug fix or thinking
through the problem you’re trying to resolve.</p>

<h2 id="label-How+you+can+help">How you can help<span><a href="#label-How+you+can+help">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>We track <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/labels/contribution%3A%20small">small
bugs and features</a> so that anyone who wants to help can start with
something that&#39;s not too overwhelming. We also keep a <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing">list
of things anyone can help with, any time</a>. If nothing on those lists
looks good, talk to us, and we&#39;ll figure out what you can help with. We
can absolutely use your help, no matter what level of programming skill you
have at the moment.</p>

<h1 id="label-Development+setup">Development setup<span><a href="#label-Development+setup">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Bundler doesn&#39;t use a Gemfile to list development dependencies, because
when we tried it we couldn&#39;t tell if we were awake or it was just
another level of dreams. To work on Bundler, you&#39;ll probably want to do
a couple of things.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Install <code>groff-base</code> and <code>graphviz</code> packages using
your package manager, e.g for ubuntu</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt-get install graphviz groff-base -y</pre>

<p>and for OS X (with brew installed)</p>

<pre>$ brew install graphviz homebrew/dupes/groff</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Install Bundler&#39;s development dependencies</p>

<pre>$ bin/rake spec:deps</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Run the test suite, to make sure things are working</p>

<pre>$ bin/rake spec</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Set up a shell alias to run Bundler from your clone, e.g. a Bash alias:</p>

<pre>$ alias dbundle=&#39;BUNDLE_TRAMPOLINE_DISABLE=1 ruby -I /path/to/bundler/lib /path/to/bundler/exe/bundle&#39;</pre>

<p>The <code>BUNDLE_TRAMPOLINE_DISABLE</code> environment variable ensures
that the version of Bundler in <code>/path/to/bundler/lib</code> will be
used. Without that environment setting, Bundler will automatically
download, install, and run the version of Bundler listed in
<code>Gemfile.lock</code>. With that set up, you can test changes
you&#39;ve made to Bundler by running <code>dbundle</code>, without
interfering with the regular <code>bundle</code> command.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>To dive into the code with Pry: <code>RUBYOPT=-rpry dbundle</code> to
require pry and then run commands.</p>

<h1 id="label-Submitting+Pull+Requests">Submitting Pull Requests<span><a href="#label-Submitting+Pull+Requests">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Before you submit a pull request, please remember to do the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Make sure the code formatting and styling adheres to the guidelines. We use
Rubocop for this. Lack of formatting adherence will result in automatic
Travis build failures.</p>

<pre>$ bin/rubocop -a</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Please run the test suite:</p>

<pre>$ bin/rspec</pre>
</li><li>
<p>If you are unable to run the entire test suite, please run the unit test
suite and at least the integration specs related to the command or domain
of Bundler that your code changes relate to.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ex. For a pull request that changes something with <code>bundle
update</code>, you might run:</p>

<pre>$ bin/rspec spec/bundler
$ bin/rspec spec/commands/update_spec.rb</pre>
</li><li>
<p>Please ensure that the commit messages included in the pull request
<strong>do not</strong> have the following:</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>@tag</code> Github user or team references (ex.
<code>@indirect</code> or <code>@bundler/core</code>)</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>#id</code> references to issues or pull requests (ex.
<code>#43</code> or <code>bundler/bundler-site#12</code>)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you want to use these mechanisms, please instead include them in the
pull request description. This prevents multiple notifications or
references being created on commit rebases or pull request/branch force
pushes.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Additionally, do not use <code>[ci skip]</code> or <code>[skip ci]</code>
mechanisms in your pull request titles/descriptions or commit messages.
Every potential commit and pull request should run through Bundler&#39;s CI
system. This applies to all changes/commits (ex. even a change to just
documentation or the removal of a comment).</p>
</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Bug+triage">Bug triage<span><a href="#label-Bug+triage">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Triage is the work of processing tickets that have been opened into
actionable issues, feature requests, or bug reports. That includes
verifying bugs, categorizing the ticket, and ensuring there&#39;s enough
information to reproduce the bug for anyone who wants to try to fix it.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve created an <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md">issues
guide</a> to walk Bundler users through the process of troubleshooting
issues and reporting bugs.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to help, awesome! You can <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/new">report a new bug</a>
or browse our <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues">existing
open tickets</a>.</p>

<p>Not every ticket will point to a bug in Bundler&#39;s code, but open
tickets usually mean that there is something we could improve to help that
user. Sometimes that means writing additional documentation, sometimes that
means making error messages clearer, and sometimes that means explaining to
a user that they need to install git to use git gems.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re looking at a ticket, here are the main questions to ask:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Can I reproduce this bug myself?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Are the steps to reproduce clearly stated in the ticket?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which versions of Bundler (1.1.x, 1.2.x, git, etc.) manifest this bug?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which operating systems (OS X, Windows, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.) manifest this
bug?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which rubies (MRI, JRuby, Rubinius, etc.) and which versions (1.8.7, 1.9.3,
etc.) have this bug?</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you can&#39;t reproduce an issue, chances are good that the bug has been
fixed (hurrah!). That&#39;s a good time to post to the ticket explaining
what you did and how it worked.</p>

<p>If you can reproduce an issue, you&#39;re well on your way to fixing it. :)
Fixing issues is similar to adding new features:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Discuss the fix on the existing issue. Coordinating with everyone else
saves duplicate work and serves as a great way to get suggestions and ideas
if you need any.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Base your commits on the correct branch. Bugfixes for 1.x versions of
Bundler should be based on the matching 1-x-stable branch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Commit the code and at least one test covering your changes to a named
branch in your fork.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Put a line in the <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>
summarizing your changes under the next release under the “Bugfixes”
heading.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Send us a <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull
request</a> from your bugfix branch.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Finally, the ticket may be a duplicate of another older ticket. If you
notice a ticket is a duplicate, simply comment on the ticket noting the
original ticket’s number. For example, you could say “This is a duplicate
of issue #42, and can be closed”.</p>

<h1 id="label-Adding+New+Features">Adding New Features<span><a href="#label-Adding+New+Features">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>If you would like to add a new feature to Bundler, please follow these
steps:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/new">Create an issue</a>
with the <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/labels/type:%20feature-request">feature-request
label</a> to discuss your feature.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Base your commits on the master branch, since we follow <a
href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a> and don&#39;t add new features to old
releases.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Commit the code and at least one test covering your changes to a feature
branch in your fork.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Send us a <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull
request</a> from your feature branch.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>If you don&#39;t hear back immediately, don’t get discouraged! We all have
day jobs, but we respond to most tickets within a day or two.</p>

<h1 id="label-Beta+testing">Beta testing<span><a href="#label-Beta+testing">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Early releases require heavy testing, especially across various system
setups. We :heart: testers, and are big fans of anyone who can run
<code>gem install bundler --pre</code> and try out upcoming releases in
their development and staging environments.</p>

<p>There may not always be prereleases or beta versions of Bundler. The
Bundler team will tweet from the <a
href="http://twitter.com/bundlerio">@bundlerio account</a> when a
prerelease or beta version becomes available. You are also always welcome
to try checking out master and building a gem yourself if you want to try
out the latest changes.</p>

<h1 id="label-Translations">Translations<span><a href="#label-Translations">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>We don&#39;t currently have any translations, but please reach out to us if
you would like to help get this going.</p>

<h1 id="label-Documentation">Documentation<span><a href="#label-Documentation">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have
trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. Because of that, we
welcome documentation suggestions and patches from everyone, especially if
they are brand new to using Bundler.</p>

<p>Bundler has two main sources of documentation: the built-in help (including
usage information and man pages) and the <a
href="http://bundler.io">Bundler documentation site</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to submit a patch to the man pages, follow the steps for
submitting a pull request above. All of the man pages are located in the
<code>man</code> directory. Just use the “Documentation” heading when you
describe what you did in the changelog.</p>

<p>If you have a suggestion or proposed change for <a
href="http://bundler.io">bundler.io</a>, please open an issue or send a
pull request to the <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site">bundler-site</a> repository.</p>

<h1 id="label-Community">Community<span><a href="#label-Community">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Community is an important part of all we do. If you’d like to be part of
the Bundler community, you can jump right in and start helping make Bundler
better for everyone who uses it.</p>

<p>It would be tremendously helpful to have more people answering questions
about Bundler (and often simply about <a
href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">Rubygems</a> or Ruby itself) in
our <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues">issue tracker</a>
or on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bundler">Stack
Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>Additional documentation and explanation is always helpful, too. If you
have any suggestions for the Bundler website <a
href="http://bundler.io">bundler.io</a>, we would absolutely love it if you
opened an issue or pull request on the <a
href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site">bundler-site</a> repository.</p>

<p>Finally, sharing your experiences and discoveries by writing them up is a
valuable way to help others who have similar problems or experiences in the
future. You can write a blog post, create an example and commit it to
Github, take screenshots, or make videos.</p>

<p>Publishing examples of how Bundler is used helps everyone, and we’ve
discovered that people already use it in ways that we never imagined when
we were writing it. If you’re still not sure what to write about, there are
also several projects doing interesting things based on Bundler. They could
probably use publicity too.</p>

<p>Finally, all contributors to the Bundler project must agree to the
contributor <a href="http://bundler.io/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.</p>
